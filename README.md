# Line-following-robot
This project is a line-following robot using Arduino Uno, IR sensors, and DC motors. It features obstacle avoidance using an ultrasonic sensor and speed control with PWM. LEDs indicate direction (forward, left, right, stop), and a buzzer alerts when obstacles are detected. The robot is designed for smooth and precise navigation.
